(Mostly) Eurorack projects.

This is a repository of the various Eurorack modules that I've been working on recently. It includes the Kicad schematics and PCB layouts that you could use to order your own PCBs.

If you would like a kit or set of PCBs from any of the projects here, please drop me an email [twigathy+synth@gmail.com](mailto:twigathy+synth@gmail.com).

The contents of this repository are licensed CC BY-NC-SA 4.0. This means you're free to use these projects directly, remix or change them, but no commercial use is permitted (Other than by me!). If you are going to re-release any of these projects you should also stick to the same license.

Finally, I'm a complete amateur when it comes to PCB and schematic design. The schematics are largely drawn from others available online, and each project contains some information about attribution. Not all the modules work perfectly - some have significant issues - and this will be noted in the README in each folder.
